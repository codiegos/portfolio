# **Portfolio**

This [website](https://dzack-portfolio.vercel.app/) is for practice and for displaying my programming abilities along side my resume. </br>
Tools used:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html): library for building user interface
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): helps with layout and design
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): frontend tooling (see script dev/build)
- JavaScript: main programming language
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/): package manager

All this is deployed to Vercel.

# Available Scripts

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
